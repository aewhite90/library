Library

Library that is user defined, adding new books by Title, Author, # of Pages, and if the book has been read.

Built for The Odin Project using javascript, html, and css to display a user input library and save the library to local storage to preserve the user's library even after exiting the site.  To be revisited in the future to move from local to cloud storage to preserve user's library experience across all devices the user is logged in on.
